Task to solve
=============

Find out whether DrScheme has operations for squaring a number; for computing the
sine of an angle and for determining the maximum of two numbers.


Solution
========

Squaring a number
-----------------

:implemented by default: yes

::
    > (sqr 4)
    16


Computing the sine of an angle
------------------------------

:implemented by default: yes

::
    > (sin 45)
    0.8509035245341184

Determining the maximum of two numbers
--------------------------------------

:implemented by default: yes

::
    > (max 4 9)
    9
